# 🚀 Launching CleanMac: A Native, Open-Source Alternative to CleanMyMac

I'm excited to announce the release of **CleanMac v1.0** — a beautiful, privacy-focused system cleaner for macOS, built entirely in SwiftUI.

I’ve always admired the utility of premium Mac cleaners, but I believe essential system maintenance shouldn't require a monthly subscription. So I built my own.

**CleanMac features:**
✨ **Native Design**: Built following Apple's Human Interface Guidelines.
🛡️ **Malware Scanner**: Local, privacy-first threat detection.
🗑️ **System Junk**: One-click cleanup of caches and logs.
📱 **App Uninstaller**: Completely removes apps and their hidden leftovers.
📊 **Space Lens**: Visual storage analysis.

It’s 100% free, open-source, and all processing happens locally on your device.

Check it out on GitHub (and give it a star! ⭐️):
